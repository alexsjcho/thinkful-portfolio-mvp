# Requirements

To be approved, your portfolio site will need to meet the following requirements. These requirements are designed to ensure your site will be up to snuff when hiring managers look at it.

1. Include a bio: The main point of the site is to communicate who you are and what you're capable of. You'll need to have a short bio that focuses on your passions and interests, insofar as they pertain to your professional life as a developer.

2. Contact info:

- include your email address
  -a link to your GitHub profile
  -contact form
  -a link to your LinkedIn profile.

3. Polished, Compelling Design and Feel: The overall look and feel should be neat, clean, and professional looking. We'll give you some tips on this later.

4. Responsive, mobile first: Will the hiring manager considering your application view your site on a phone or a desktop, or both? Who knows! So make sure your site is responsive and looks good on any screen size. Optimize for mobile first, and optionally progressively enhance for larger screens.

5. Titles, short descriptions, links, and screenshots: For each app you showcase, you should include the app name, a link to the live app and repo, a short description, and a compelling screenshot.

6. Only code from scratch projects: Apps like fizzbuzz and the shopping list do not belong in your portfolio. To begin with, you can add your quiz app from the previous module. Later in the program, you'll create at least 3 capstone projects, which you should include in your portfolio.

7. No CSS frameworks or templates: It can be tempting to use tools like Bootstrap and Materialize to achieve the look you want for your portfolio, but that's not what most employers want to see. This site is your first chance to demonstrate your skills as a web developer. A site styled with vanilla CSS will stand out far more.

8. No errors in the console: Hiring managers usually have a ton of applicants, which means they're initially looking for quick reasons to dismiss you. If they open up DevTools on your portfolio site and see errors, that may be enough to pass you over. So make sure your final site doesn't have any errors.

9. Reasonable load time: We'll discuss how to achieve this later, but the page should load quickly (i.e., 2 seconds or less).
